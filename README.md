# This project delves into the intricacies of distinguishing between real human faces and those generated by artificial intelligence (AI). By analyzing a collection of images, the project explores the subtle cues that reveal the artificial nature of AI-generated faces, providing insights into the capabilities and limitations of current AI technology. This exploration not only enhances our understanding of AI's ability to mimic human appearance but also raises questions about the implications of AI-generated imagery in various contexts.
